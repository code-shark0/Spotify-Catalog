# Lightweight Spotify Catalog
### By: Eli Green

The goal of this project was to create a lightweight Spotify catalog application that would allow users to view their Spotify catalog in a simple, and user-friendly interface.

It allows users to login with their spotify account, then view their catalog of saved Albums, Tracks, and Episodes. 

Limited time was spent on the project, so any additional features, bugfixes, or improvements are either implicit or explicitely written as comments throughout the code.
